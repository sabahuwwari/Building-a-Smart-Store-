# Building-a-Smart-Store-
 Using IoT in Retail to Build a Smart Store is my project title. In my project,  I discussed how to use IoT in building a Smart store that gives the customer an easy and comfortable in-store experience using sensors. Also, the retailer will know about his store situation and customer behavior  from his device in real-time. All information depends on the sensor's  data which will be existed in the store, and each of them does a specific  mission. I relied on Arduino to run the sensors, and I used the Ethernet to  send sensor data to the database, which I used later on the store website
 Here are what you need to do :
1- Prepare the arduino uno, Ethernet Shield, and sensors, then test the sensors using the code that exists in sensors code.ino
2- Connect an ethernet wire in the Ethernet shield and the other side with any Ethernet input 
3- run the arduino code again in addation to the code that exists in humidity sensor.php file 
4- Finally, open the databse table and click refresh to monitor the changes
